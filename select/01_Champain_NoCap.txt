Soon as we land girl we jumping on Another plane
I'll take cross the world and hope
You forget everything
Yeah, yeah
Go to war for love I'm a soldier
Don't nobody wanna die sober
Not on the same planet I been moving up
Aliens tryna ban me from Jupiter
I'ma glow of they hit
The lights in this club
I'ma glow if they hit
The lights in this club
Check the motor nigga went and
Put my hood on flex
Ten bad bitches tryna to take one X
I came to have a good time ain't
Worried about the sex tonight
UFO wouldn't crack up i had to take
The jet tonight
Burning my sheets money don't
Came If you sleep oh
This party free but you can't came in
If you not geeked off drugs
When I first had met you
You had told me You don't drink
Then I had walked in and seen you
Swimmin' in champagne
I wanna put your ex in a box, but, nah
I respect it, gang
You wanna tell me that I'm great
But you protectin' your pride
They say it's easier to lose when
It's a lot on your mind
I can take my whole environment
And put them in line
It's kind of easier to tell you that
I'm one of a kind
If everyone in here is you
Then it's hard to choose
If everyone in here is you
Then it's hard to choose
If everyone in here is you
Then it's hard to choose
I know whatever in your cup
Will make you forget the night
You know whatever in my cup
I'm takin' chances with life, mm
Bartender can't serve this
Tell the ambulance to hurry
When I see you, it's an emergency
When I step, I leave paws and snakes
All on My shoes
This is Gucci on your carpet
Pull off in that Honda and
Come back in a Ferrari
Check the motor nigga went and
Put my hood on flex
Ten bad bitches tryna to take one X
I came to have a good time ain't
Worried about the sex tonight
UFO wouldn't crack up i had to take
The jet tonight
Burning my sheets money don't
Came If you sleep oh
This party free but you can't came in
If you not geeked off drugs
When I first had met you
You had told me You don't drink
Then I had walked in and seen you Swimmin' in champagne
I wanna put your ex in a box, but, nah
I respect it, gang
