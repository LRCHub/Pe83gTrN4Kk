Livin' on the road is so much fun
Boy, you are ugly and your girlfriend needs a man
We were sittin' in our car in a traffic jam
And some guy screams, 200 bucks a gram!

Shut up!

No we won't shut up
We're just babblin' on and on
Babylon, babblin' on and on

Pussycat shut up! You wake up late for school
And you don't wanna go
You ask your mom, please, but she still says no
Went outside, said, your place not mine
Chop 'em out, baby,'cause I need another line!

Shut up!

No we won't shut up
We're just babblin' on and on
Babylon, babblin' on and on

Caught in Bel Air with Chippy and Biffy
And someone says, hey guys, you want some sniffy?
On the trigger was a punch and we put a spanish fly
Biffy's without spot and Chippy's on my tigh

Shut up!

No we wont' shut up
We're just babblin' on and on
Babylon, babblin' on and on

Pussycat shut up! You boys, you're disgusting
Shut up!

Yeah, shut the fuck up...
